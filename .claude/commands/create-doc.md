Distill the conversation so far into a specification document.

1. Verify that requirements (why), specifications (what), and design (how) are all clearly established in the conversation. If any are missing, stop and tell the user what is needed.
2. Write the file:
   - Language: English
   - Format: Markdown
   - Path: `specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<subject>.md` (use today's date)
   - Sections: Requirements (or Problem, or Motivation — choose the most fitting), Specifications, Design
3. Commit to Git.

After completing, propose running `/create-test-cases`.
